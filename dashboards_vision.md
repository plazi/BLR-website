### treatments

**How to Read This File**
After every dashboard, I added search type labels to indicate which of those would have that given dashboard displayed. Thus, if one search type is missing, the dashboard shouldn't be included.

**Dashboards/Charts**

1. **treatments x year** 
    - [taxon] [journal] [author] [institution/collection] [projects]

2. **treatments x supra-specific taxa**
    - [taxon]* [journal] [author] [institution/collection] [projects]
    - Showing the top 5 and grouping the rest, determining the taxonomic ranking to be shown based on "most common taxon across all treatments", picking one level below that. 
    - When searching by taxon, automatically builds the chart using one level bellow (e.g., if the search was at family level, the chart will be at genera level). 
    - '* If the taxon searched is at species level, doesn't display this chart.

3. **treatments x journal** 
    - [taxon] [author] [institution/collection] [projects]
